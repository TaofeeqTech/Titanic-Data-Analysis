# Titanic-Data-Analysis

Here is my workout project on Titanic Dataset using Python. I have answered the questions below using the power of Python;
1. Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages, Gender, Class, ... etc)
2. What Deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
3. Where did the passengers come from?
4. Who was alone and who was with family?
5. What factors helped someone survive the sinking?
The answers to above questions can be found on python notebook below;
